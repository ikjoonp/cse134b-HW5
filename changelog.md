Part 1:

Added a Native Dialogs section to my navbar along with a correspondingly linked html file. The site is very barebones, merely addressing the requirements for part 1. I chose keep it simple and perhaps merge it with the Experiments section later.

Part 2:

Added a Custom Dialogs section to my navbar along with a correspondingly linked html file. The site is, again, very barebones with the intention of merging it with the Experiments section later.

Part 3 and 4:

Added a Blog section to my navbar that leads to the unstyled crud.html file. From there, I linked the styledcrud.html file. I chose to do this because I thought that the navbar would benefit from remaining somewhat spacious in the homepage. The styledcrud.html file is merely the crud.html file with css applied. Still somewhat of an eyesore, aim to improve later.
